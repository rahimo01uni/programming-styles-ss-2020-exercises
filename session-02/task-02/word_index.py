# Program Description:
#
# Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and
# outputs all the words contained in it
# sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur.
# The program assumes that a page is a
# sequence of 45 lines, each line has max 80 characters, and there is no
# hyphenation. Additionally, Word Index
# must ignore all words that occur more than 100 times.


# Pipeline Style Description:
#   - Larger problem decomposed in functional abstractions.
#       Functions, according to Mathematics, are relations from inputs to outputs.
#   - Larger problem solved as a pipeline of function applications

# Global Constants:
#   Q1: Do the constants violate the style?
