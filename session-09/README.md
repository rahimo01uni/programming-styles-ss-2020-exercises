# Exercise 09

Implement the Word Index program using concurrency Programming Styles.

Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and outputs all the words contained in it sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur. The program assumes that a page is a sequence of 45 lines, each line has max 80 characters, and there is no hyphenation. Additionally, Word Index must ignore all words that occur more than 100 times.

For both tasks there's already an empty `word_index.py` that you can fill.

## Task 1: Actors Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Actors Style** 

> Note: the Actors style is a variation of the Letterbox style, hence both styles use the same decomposition of the large program into things.


## Task 2: Dataspaces Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Dataspaces Style**
