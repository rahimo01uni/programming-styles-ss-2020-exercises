# Program Description:
#
# Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and
# outputs all the words contained in it
# sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur.
# The program assumes that a page is a
# sequence of 45 lines, each line has max 80 characters, and there is no
# hyphenation. Additionally, Word Index
# must ignore all words that occur more than 100 times.

#
# The Infinite Mirror Style Description:
#
# - All, or a significant part, of the problem is modelled by
#   induction. That is, specify the base case (n_0) and then the n+1
#   rule
