# Program Description:
#
# Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and
# outputs all the words contained in it
# sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur.
# The program assumes that a page is a
# sequence of 45 lines, each line has max 80 characters, and there is no
# hyphenation. Additionally, Word Index
# must ignore all words that occur more than 100 times.


#
# The Aspects Style Description:
#
# - The problem is decomposed using some form of abstraction (procedures, functions, objects, etc.)
#
# - Aspects of the problem are added to the main program without any
#   edits to the source code of the abstractions. These side functions
#   latch on the main abstractions by naming them, as in "I'm an aspect
#   of foo (even though foo may not know it!)"
