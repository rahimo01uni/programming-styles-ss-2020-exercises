# Exercise 04

Implement the Word Index program using the Objects Communication Programming Styles.

Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and outputs all the words contained in it sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur. The program assumes that a page is a sequence of 45 lines, each line has max 80 characters, and there is no hyphenation. Additionally, Word Index must ignore all words that occur more than 100 times.

For both tasks there's already an empty `word_index.py` that you can fill.
